Franchise by Flashgitz
Game developed by me (Mexlicano/Hackiena)

The following Python modules I used:
- pygame (Well duh.)
- pytmx (For loading the data from tmx file)
- os (For creating the paths of the game's folders)
- random (For creating the furry spawns)
- sys (For shuting down this game)
- win32api (For getting your monitor's refresh rate)

The following softwares I used:
- Visual Studio Code (Formerly)
- Pycharm (For scripting the game, just like VS Code. (The fake warnings are my only complaints) )
- FireAlpaca (For drawing the images like furries, marine (not really), food, bushes, etc.)
- Tiled (For creating a map with few layers.)
- Paint.net (For creating the spritesheet tiles)
